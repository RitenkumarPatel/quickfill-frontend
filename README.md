# Front-End Overview

This repository contains the front-end code for our Chrome extension, built using TypeScript, JSX, and React. The extension's user interface was developed to provide a seamless and intuitive experience, leveraging modern web technologies to interact with the back-end services.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript: Ensures type safety and helps catch errors during development, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- React: Utilized to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allowed us to build reusable UI components efficiently.
- CSS: Styled all the components, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.
- TSX: Combined TypeScript with JSX to create .tsx files, enabling us to write strongly-typed components with inline markup and logic.

## Project Structure

Each UI component is structured in a modular way, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability. The components interact with the back-end services, providing real-time updates and responses to the user.
